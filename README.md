# AI vs Human Text Classifier:

This project compares a traditional Deep Neural Network (DNN) and a Transformer-based BERT model to detect whether a paragraph was written by a human or generated by AI. Built as a full-stack Flask web application with a backend powered by TensorFlow and Hugging Face Transformers.

## Tech Stack:

- **Frontend**: HTML
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning**:
  - TensorFlow + Keras (for DNN)
  - Hugging Face Transformers (BERT model)
  - PyTorch (for BERT runtime)
- **Deployment**: Docker, Google Cloud Run
- **Others**: Git LFS, scikit-learn, pandas

## Dataset:

A CSV of ~487,000 samples labeled as either AI-generated or human-written.

üîó **Web App**: [Live Web App](https://bert-vs-dnn-aitextclassifier-555399477095.us-central1.run.app/)

## Features:

- DNN and BERT predictions side-by-side
- Confidence/logits shown for transparency
- Educational disclaimer about classifier limitations
- Dockerized for easy deployment

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer:

This tool is for educational purposes only. The models may yield false positives/negatives and should not be used for serious academic or forensic judgments.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è TODOs:

Currently working to retrain models for better accuracy, as currently, I find it assumes text is human-written a vast majority of the time, even when very obviously AI. I believe this is due to overfitting, as accuracy is very high on the training data, but seems to be low elsewhere. 

Note: Retraining BERT requires significant computational time and resources, so I‚Äôve been working within available constraints to make incremental improvements

## Getting Started:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JustinV200/Bert.vs.DNN-AITextClassifier.git
cd Bert.vs.DNN-AITextClassifier

# Optional: create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
