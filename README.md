# AI vs Human Text Classifier:

This project compares a traditional Deep Neural Network (DNN) and a Transformer-based BERT model to detect whether a paragraph was written by a human or generated by AI. Built as a full-stack Flask web application with a backend powered by TensorFlow and Hugging Face Transformers.

## Tech Stack:

- **Frontend**: HTML
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning**:
  - TensorFlow + Keras (for DNN)
  - Hugging Face Transformers (BERT model)
  - PyTorch (for BERT runtime)
- **Deployment**: Docker, Google Cloud Run
- **Others**: Git LFS, scikit-learn, pandas

## Dataset:

A CSV of ~487,000 samples labeled as either AI-generated or human-written.

🔗 **Dataset Source**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shanegerami/ai-vs-human-text

## Live Demo: 

Visit the hosted site here(See Disclaimer and TODO's):  

🔗 **Web App**: **took this down, run locally to try it out, currently focusing efforts to optomize models with keystroke synthesis, see other repo, also found dataset to be heavily flawed and am looking to redo with something entirely new**

## Features:

- DNN and BERT predictions side-by-side
- Confidence/logits shown for transparency
- Dockerized for easy deployment

## ⚠️ Disclaimer:

This tool is for educational purposes only. The models may yield false positives/negatives and should not be used for serious academic or forensic judgments.

## ⚠️ TODOs:

built and prove accuracy of keystroke synthesizer(see other repo), find new dataset, retrain.

## Getting Started:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JustinV200/Bert.vs.DNN-AITextClassifier.git
cd Bert.vs.DNN-AITextClassifier

# Optional: create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
